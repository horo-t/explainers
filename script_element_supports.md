# HTMLScriptElement.supports(type) method

Author: horo@chromium.org - Last Updated: 2021-09-06

## Summary

Provides a unified way to detect new features that use script elements.

## Motivation

Currently there is no simple way to know what kind of types can be used for `HTMLScriptElement`â€™s `type` attribute. 

There are several new feature proposals using the script element.
- [Import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) use `type="importmap"`.
- [Speculation rules](https://github.com/jeremyroman/alternate-loading-modes/blob/main/triggers.md#speculation-rules) use `type="speculationrules"`.
- [Bundle preloading](https://github.com/WICG/resource-bundles/) use `type="bundlepreload"`.

We can use the `nomodule` attribute to detect the `module` type support as [this example](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-nomodule-example) shows.
But there is no unified method to detect such new features. (E.g.: https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/171)
If we have the `HTMLScriptElement.supports(type)` method which is like `HTMLLinkElement.relList.supports()`, we can easily detect such features.

## Usage

```javascript
if (HTMLScriptElement.supports('importmap')) {
  console.log('Your browser supports import maps.');
}
if (HTMLScriptElement.supports('speculationrules')) {
  console.log('Your browser supports speculationrules.');
}
if (HTMLScriptElement.supports('bundlepreload')) {
  console.log('Your browser supports bundlepreload.');
}
```

## Security Considerations

There are no known security impacts of this API.

## Privacy Considerations

This API can be used as part of browser fingerprinting technique of checking the
availability of each feature. However, in general, these are already
[feature-detectable][feature-detect]
by asynchronous way or by fetching useless HTTP requests.
This API itself only introduces one bit of information about the availability of
the API itself. But, this is also the case when introducing any other new
[feature-detectable][feature-detect] APIs.
