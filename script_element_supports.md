# HTMLScriptElement.supports(type) method

Author: horo@chromium.org - Last Updated: 2021-09-01

## Summary

Provides a unified way to detect new features that use script elements.

## Motivation

Currently there is no simple way to know what kind of types can be used for `HTMLScriptElement`â€™s `type` attribute. 

There are several new feature proposals using the script element.
- [Import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) use `type="importmap"`.
- [Speculation rules](https://github.com/jeremyroman/alternate-loading-modes/blob/main/triggers.md#speculation-rules) use `type="speculationrules"`.
- [Bundle preloading](https://github.com/WICG/resource-bundles/) use `type="bundlepreload"`.

We can use the `nomodule` attribute to detect the `module` type support as [this example](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-nomodule-example) shows.
But there is no unified method to detect such new features. (E.g.: https://github.com/WICG/import-maps/issues/171)
If we have the `HTMLScriptElement.supports(type)` method which is like `HTMLLinkElement.relList.supports()`, we can easily detect such features.

## Usage

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
if (script.supports('importmap')) {
  console.log('Your browser supports import maps.');
}
if (script.supports('speculationrules')) {
  console.log('Your browser supports speculationrules.');
}
if (script.supports('bundlepreload')) {
  console.log('Your browser supports bundlepreload.');
}
```

## Security Considerations

There are no known security impacts of this API.

## Privacy Considerations

This API can be used for fingerprinting by checking the availability of each feature.
However, the Web Platform Design Principles require that each feature be [detectable](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#feature-detect).
And this API itself only introduces one bit of information about the availability of the API itself.
